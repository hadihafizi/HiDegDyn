Population Coupling Analysis:

Purpose: Calculate population coupling (directed similarity) for all neurons once with respect to RC sub-population and
	 once with respect to non-RC sub-population.

Sequence of running the scripts:

			1) Run_PopCoup_All.m
			2) PopCoup_Figs.m --> Plots population coupling values and distributions for a data set.
			3) PopCoup_Figs_AllDataSets.m --> Aggregates all population coupling values for all data sets
							  and plots the distributions for their aggregate.
